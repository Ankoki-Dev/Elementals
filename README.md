# Elementals
A project to mess around with Lombok that i'm actually enjoying developing and plan on releasing eventually. 
Depends on RedLib and if your planning to create a fork you will need Lombok installed on your IDE.
You can find the RedLib source code [here](https://www.github.com/Redempt/RedLib). 
You can find the RedLib download on spigot [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/redlib.78713/).
